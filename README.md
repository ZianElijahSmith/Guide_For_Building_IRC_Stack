# Guide_For_Building_IRC_Stack
This is not a program, it is a step by step guide for you to build an IRC "Stack" on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) from a VPS company like Vultr. It is called a "Stack" because this guide includes more than just building an IRC, you can combine the IRC with Mumble and other things.
