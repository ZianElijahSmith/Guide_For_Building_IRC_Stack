# Guide For Building IRC "Stack" 
# The base is complete, the rest is being updated
(Debian + Nginx + UnrealIRCd + Anope + etc)
<br><br>
This is **NOT** a program, it is a step by step guide for you to build an IRC "Stack"
Please read the guide here on substack (It's free and has photos, the github will be updated):
https://open.substack.com/pub/ziansmith/p/guide-how-to-make-an-irc-server-stack

The files in this repo are for this guide.

# Purpose for this guide
It is with genuine and benevolent intentions that this guide helps **ANYONE** build their own independent communications medium.
Censorship of **true & accurate information** on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, etc have become more common.
Once you have your own server that you run, you won't have to worry about anyone "suspending" or "banning" you, especially if you run on a local machine and not on a vps.
<br>
#### Side note, if you want to help make a version of this guide to build this stack in a different order, like Debian -> Apache -> InspIRCd, etc. that would be helpful

You DO NOT need to know how to code, and hopefully you find this guide useful even if you don't have a lot of technical knowledge or skills.
This guide does assume you know how to use SSH to access your VPS, and it also assumes you know how to use sudo for root privleges.
